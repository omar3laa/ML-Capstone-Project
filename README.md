## Project Goal

The primary objective of this capstone project is to design, implement, and evaluate a complete machine learning pipeline that addresses multiple real-world problems.

First, a Regression Model is developed to predict continuous housing prices using the California Housing dataset.

Second, a Classification Model is built to support the early diagnosis of heart disease by predicting patient risk levels.

Finally, Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) techniques are applied to uncover hidden patterns and meaningful groupings within the data.
